# Covid lead

A platform to find verified covid leads in India (https://covidlead.com).

## Getting Started

You can filter based on location and the resource required (oxygen, ICU, Medicine, Bed, etc).

There is also an upvote counter attached with every post using which users can upvote and downvote a lead. Upvote count can be used to determine whether the post is genuine or not.

A separate screen is also made where users can filter according to their need and location and can see filtered tweets.

You can also become a volunteer and add verified leads to the website.

A separate admin panel is also created for volunteers to add leads easily.
